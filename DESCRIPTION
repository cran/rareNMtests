Description: Randomization tests for the statistical comparison of i = two or more individual-based, sample-based or coverage-based rarefaction curves. The ecological null hypothesis is that the i samples were all drawn randomly from a single assemblage, with (necessarily) a single underlying species abundance distribution. The biogeographic null hypothesis is that the i samples were all drawn from different assemblages that, nonetheless, share similar species richness and species abundance distributions. Functions are described in L. Cayuela, N.J. Gotelli & R.K. Colwell (2015) <doi:10.1890/14-1261.1>.
